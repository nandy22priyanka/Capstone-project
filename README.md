# Capstone-project

The Project is basically a Ecommerce website for home decors.
This project consists of two parts the front-end and the back-end.
The back-end is build using spring boot microservice.
To run the spring boot microservice first of all we have to start the sts ide and move to our desired folder
Then we have to start by running the service registry file
After that we have to run the albums in this order: user> discount> product category> product> cart> wishlist> sales.
At last we have to run the api gateway file
