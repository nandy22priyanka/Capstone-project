# Capstone-project

The Project is basically a Ecommerce website for home decors.</br>
This project consists of two parts the front-end and the back-end.</br>
The back-end is build using spring boot microservice.</br>
To run the spring boot microservice first of all we have to start the sts ide and move to our desired folder.</br>
Then we have to start by running the service registry file.</br>
After that we have to run the albums in this order: user> discount> product category> product> cart> wishlist> sales.</br>
At last we have to run the api gateway file
